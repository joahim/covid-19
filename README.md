# COVID-19 Data for Slovenia

This repository contains the code for visualizing the COVID-19 Data for Slovenia.

The visualization is available at https://joahim.github.io/covid-19

The data used in the visualization is sourced from the excellent resource https://tinyurl.com/slo-covid-19.

For more in-depth information about the COVID-19 in Slovenia you may also want to check https://covid19.rtfm.si/.

Note: until I discovered https://tinyurl.com/slo-covid-19 this project collected it's own. I do not plan to do that anymore.
